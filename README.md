# Shearwater2Subsurface
Exports dive log records from Shearwater dive computers for import into Subsurface.  I wasn't happy with how Subsurface imports records, I wanted more control over things.  So I wrote a utility to help with some of the things I found frustrating.

1) Renumber records
2) Merge records - any trip to the surface and my Petral counts as another dive.  Set a descent line, dive, get group on the boat, retrieve descent line.  Three records.  I want one.
